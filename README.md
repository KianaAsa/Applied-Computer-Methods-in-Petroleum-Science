Reservoir simulation is vital for reservoir engineers to understand real reservoir behavior and simulate oil and gas flow. This report details oil production simulation using numerical approximation and finite difference methods in Python, ensuring stability, convergence, consistency, and addressing boundary conditions.
Reservoir simulation is one of the most significant tasks and needs for reservoir engineers because it helps them to figure out how a reservoir behave in reality. It also allows reservoir engineers to simulate oil and gas flow. This report is provided with information regarding simulation of oil production of a reservoir based on numerical approximation using finite difference methods. The coding in python is done with the help of methods such as stability, convergence, consistency and boundary conditions.
